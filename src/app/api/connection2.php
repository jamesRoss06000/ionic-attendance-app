// Connecting. DSN
// PDO has a fancy connection method called DSN. It's nothing complicated though - instead of one plain and simple list of options, PDO asks you to input different configuration directives in three different places:

// database driver, host, db (schema) name and charset, as well as less frequently used port and unix_socket go into DSN;
// username and password go to constructor;
// all other options go into options array.
// where DSN is a semicolon-delimited string, consists of param=value pairs, that begins from the driver name and a colon
